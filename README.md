A one-weekend group project developed after classes at <Academia_de_CÃ³digo_>

//The Idea

Taking inspiration from the classic Bulletin Board System's (BBSs), we developed two command-line based applications: one for the client and another for the server. The aim of the project was to emulate the functioning of a BBS forum that took advantage of the networking and concurrency features of the Java programming language.

// The Development

Although we didn't have much time to develop the initial idea, we ended up with a project that not only fulfills the curriculum's requisites but also supports several command-line commands. The two final apps can thus be fully expanded in order to support additional features.

// My role

I suggested the initial idea for the project which was later on improved with the Master Coders' help. I also helped devising a solution for storing messages in files so that they can subsequently be accessed each time a new user enters an existing forum.

//Tech && Methodologies

Java, IntelliJ, Mac Os, Ant, Git
